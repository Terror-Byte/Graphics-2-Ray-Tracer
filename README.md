# Graphics-2-Ray-Tracer
This project is a ray tracer made with C++ and OpenGL as part of the Graphics 2 module during the 2nd year of my degree.

The aim of this project was to develop a ray tracer capable of performing ray-plane, ray-triangle, and ray-sphere intersection, and if time allowed to implement shadow rays, refraction, and reflection. I managed to implement basic forms of all of these requirements in this project.

All of the files present were given to students as skeleton of a basic working OpenGL program to build their ray tracers in. The skeleton program handles the loading in of the scene and the objects within it, implements the primitive classes for planes, triangles, spheres, ray's, etc and implements a camera to be used by the ray tracer. The following methods were implemented by the students: Plane::IntersectByRay, Triangle::IntersectByRay, Sphere::IntersectByRay, RayTracer::TraceScene and RayTracer::CalculateLighting. The majority of the code present in these methods is my own.
